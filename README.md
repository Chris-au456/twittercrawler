## Chris' Twitter Monitor ##

### Write a Python program that monitors a twitter account. 

```
The program must output text from new tweets to stdout.
```

```
The program must output the 5 most recent tweets right after execution, then it must check for new tweets (and display them) every 10 mins.
```

```
The Twitter handle will be provided as a command line argument by the user starting the program
```

```
Make sure to use scraping or APIs that do not require user authentication or a twitter developer account.
```

```
Must not use open source libraries such as Twint, Tweepy to do the heavy lifting
```

### Bonus round #1:
```
Modify your Python program to add a simple API to dump all the tweets collected so far in JSON format via a simple curl command.  
```

### Bonus round #2: 
```
Write a Dockerfile that encapsulates this program. The Dockerfile should expose your API and also enable the tweets to be seen via stdout. 
```
